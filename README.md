Build a Ruby class for a `Building` that:

* Initializes with a name, address, number of floors, and number of tenants
* The name and number of tenants should be readable and writeable
* The address should be readable
* The number of floors should not be readable or writeable
* The class should keep track of all buildings that are created
* The class should tell the average number of tenants in a building
* A building should have a placard method that returns the name and address of the building
* A building should have a method returns the average number of tenants per floor

Then:

Make objects for the three buildings on this corner. Use a Fermi estimate for the number of tenants.
